        <h2>Help the Cats!</h2>
        <p>Here at Big Cat Rescue, literally 100% 
            of your donations are spent <br> directly
            ON THE CATS!!! We are able to adhere <br>to that strict policy because the other sanctuary expenses, <br>
            administrative expenses, 
            salaries etc come out of tour fees <br>and other sources of income. We are extremely serious <br>
            about donations being used <br>JUST FOR THE CATS!</p>

    <h2>Volunteer</h2>
    <p>
        The volunteer program is largely responsible<br> for the day-to-day operations of the sanctuary.<br> The
        sanctuary relies heavily on volunteers for <br> cleaning, feeding, animal care, as well as soliciting <br>
        donations, administrative tasks, and working in the <br> onsite gift shop. The sanctuary is run completely <br>on donations
        that are brought in through tours, <br> memberships, sponsorships, and gift shop sales. 
        <br>
        <br>Big Cat Rescue is a unique sanctuary 
        dedicated <br> to the care of abused, orphaned, abandoned, <br>unwanted, 
        and elderly wild & exotic animals. The <br> operation of this facility is very 
        costly and relies <br> heavily on an active volunteer organization to help <br> offset
        some of <br>those costs as well as allowing us to provide a better<br> life for the animals.
